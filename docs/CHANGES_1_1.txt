Client side:

Fixed handling of faults (fault XML was not parsed when the HTTP error code was correctly set to 500 by the server)
Fixed serialization of times and datetimes, to use ISO format and include milliseconds
Support for hexBinary
Response parsing in KDSoapMessage: implement type conversion based on type information sent back, fix handling of empty strings.
Fix compilation error when the name of a wsdl:service contains a '-'.

NEW: server side support
