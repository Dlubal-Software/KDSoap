General:
========
* Fix compilation with gcc-4.6, and fix behavior with Qt-4.8

Client-side:
============
* Generic soapError() signal, for central processing of all SOAP errors (faults) [Jira SOAP-6]
* Fix support for the "short" and "unsignedShort" data types
* Apply end point configuration changes also if interface was already used
* Support for network cookies, see setCookieJar(). Requires Qt >= 4.7.0
* Support for network proxies, see setProxy() and the class QNetworkProxy in Qt.
* Generated code: make clientInterface() public, add const overload.
* Generate additional job-based API for asynchronous calls.

Server-side:
============
* Support for delayed responses
* Fix support for messages with no input or output arguments
* Set response namespace automatically in generated processRequest, so as to not rely on the namespace
  of the incoming request.
* Fix parsing of requests with Qt-4.8.
* Fix crash in Qt-4.8 at server shutdown.
* Return an error if receiving a GET request (other than when retrieving the .wsdl file)

Code generator changes, applying to both client and server side:
================================================================
* Handle paths with non-ascii letters (url encoding issues).
* Handle wsdl files with multiple service definitions
* Reworked parsing of XML namespaces.
* New option -namespace <...> to kdwsdl2cpp, in order to put all the generated code into a C++ namespace.
* Better handling of whether elements are "qualified" or not, and writing out the correct namespace for them.
